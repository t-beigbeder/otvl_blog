# About

### What

You will find here articles in the domains of software development, data engineering,
software engineering, system architecture, system deployment,
and related methods and practices.

The articles contents are rather technical, yet by no means reserved to specialists.
The goal is to share information and know-how acquired through readings, work, practice,
but in first place thanks to the works and help of so many other people.
