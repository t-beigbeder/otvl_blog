# Using Cabri to share data with confidence

## Introduction

Cabri is a free and open source tool designed specifically to store data and synchronize it on various media,
between different places, with the people you want.

It is both fast and secure, providing confidentiality in untrusted environments.

It is mainly available as a command-line tool, but also provides an API (Golang and REST). A GUI is under development.
It is currently in beta release.

This short presentation is to show you what you could do with it.

## Backup your files on external drive

Cabri manages what it calls Data Storage Systems (DSS). A DSS is a collection of data files along with their metadata:
name and related location, size, last modification time, checksum, access rights.
You can also have Cabri deal with a local directory as if it were a DSS.
And because Cabri provides an efficient synchronization tool, you can backup a local directory's content
on a DSS located on an external drive.

__Illustration here.__

Your operating system for sure already does it very well. What Cabri adds in that case is:

- managing data files checksums to detect possible data corruption
- incremental storage: successive synchronizations don't erase previous content but only add new content
or make removed content invisible in its parent directory, anyway the full history is available
until you explicitly delete portions of it
