# Developing and simple hosting with K3s

<div otvl-web>

## Introduction

[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is a lightweight yet very effective
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) open source distribution.

While Docker and the Kubernetes orchestrator are leveraged more and more often
for hosting application components,
two interesting questions often remain open:

- how to work locally as a developer:
this is useful to set up, test and debug
the deployment more efficiently than if working remotely,
but also to leverage local computing resources
- how to orchestrate application containers in production environments
where there is no managed Kubernetes solution, or no cost-effective one either

This article provides feedback for deploying and using K3s for development
and simple production.

## Installing K3s for development

Depending on your way of working, you can install K3s either directly on the development host
or on a separate virtual machine that you will access remotely with `kubectl`.
Unless you want to test multi-node specific use-cases in development,
the default installation with all the components on a single node
is all what you need:

    :::text
    # curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

Having a look at the [architecture document](https://docs.k3s.io/architecture),
this means we run the K3s server components on the installed host,
and there is no K3s agent node.
